	$("#activity-content").append("<p>Through joining a sorority, I have learned a great deal about leadership, teamwork, and how to building a two-story booth. Traditionally, Carnegie Mellon holds an event every year called Carnival. During Carnival week, classes are cancelled and the local community comes out to see the impressive booths that each organization has built for the event. These booths house games for the children and adults to play while walking through the booth. The artwork, both interior and exterior, are always extremely detailed and awards are given out to the best booths of the year.</p> ");

Being a recruitment counselor (rho sig) meant I was to disaffiliate from my chapter and provide non-bias advice to potential new members going through recruitment. Through this process, I served as a mentor to my group of girls, taking the role of a listener if they had concerns or doubts about the process or joining greek life. By being a rho sigma, I was able to interact with different types of girls and figure out how to properly communicate as well as give advice to them.</p>");

By joining Apex, I was able to understand the struggles of being an organization at its infancy.

The lab conducts studies on infants as well as adults to find out how infants learn language and what affects an infant's ability to learn. A great deal of the studies involve statistical learning. As a research assistant at the lab, I learned how to run studies, interact with infants, and how to conduct myself in a lab.</p>");
	$("#activity-content").append("<p>I had joined the lab as a freshman still unsure of the path I wanted to take in my professional career. Before realizing my passion was in web development, I had seriously thought about going to medical school. Thus, the lab provided a great opportunity to get real experience dealing with the most difficult patients: infants. As someone who loves children, working at the lab was incredibly enjoyable and I gained valuable insight on how research works in academia.</p>")
