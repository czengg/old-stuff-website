                    I am a senior information systems major with a double major in human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. I am interested in web development and web-based applications. Primarily, I'm focused on front-end development of a web application, working with small teams to create and deploy projects. I've had my fair share of experience working with multiple javascript libraries, integrating apis, and running my own server.

                    Aside from developing personal projects, I am involved in several activities on campus. I am a part of greek life where we fundrase for our local philanthropy as well as do community service as a way of giving back. Aside from being in a sorority, I am a research assistant with the Social Computing group of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. In my free time, I enjoy playing the ukulele and guitar, discovering new bands and music, writing, and watching tv shows on hulu.

                        <p>The UX Library was an endeavor to bring a comprehensive user experience library that would be utilized for all future applications, giving a central look and feel to all new technologies.</p>
                        <p>For the ADR site, I was responsible for helping restructure the popular client-facing site using rapid prototyping tools such as Axure.</p>

                        <p>This mock poster series was done as a project for my fundamentals design class.</p>
                        <p>The concept behind this poster series is utilizing letter shape to create a centralized illustration or feeling that conveys the artist's musical stylings.</p>
                        <p>Swear and Shake is an indie folk band, giving it down-to-earth, nature-like qualities. Thus, the coloring followed that theme with the illustration of the S's lending way to ideas of comraderie and home.</p>
                        <p>Pretty Lights is a electronic dj with warm undertones to his songs. There's a sense of being surrounded by acquaintances in a lounge in the 50s. Thus, the colors are overwhelmingly warm. The illustration of the P as the sun further drives the idea of warmth.</p>
                        <p>The Knocks is an electronic duo with a very groovy sound. They seem, to me, to be an artist that you listen to surrounded by close friends, swaying and dancing. Thus, the colors have a warmth to them, but with a retro styling. The illustrations of the T and K are very straightforward, like the band, lanky and awkward but still cool.</p>

                        <p>My role as a front-end software engineering intern at Drawbridge, a startup based in San Mateo, was to assist the front-end engineering department on various features and bug fixes each spring cycle. Unlike other internships where an intern is given a summer project for the entirety of the internship, I was treated as a full-time employee, implementing features and working with the engineering, marketing, and sales team to complete tasks for each sprint.</p>
                        <p>Due to the relatively small nature of Drawbridge, the front-end engineering team consisted of two other full-time employees and myself. This gave me an amazing opportunity to gain experience in a variety of technologies as well as made me feel personally responsible and accountable for all the code I contributed to the codebase.</p>
                        <p>I worked extensively with Javascript, PHP, and some Java during my time at drawbridge. I also gained further experience in frameworks such as base.js, d3, jQuery, underscore, etc.</p>

                        <p>I had a great experience taking the role of lead software engineer and student consultant to Zero Waste Pittsburgh's intiative to try to bring the nonprofit into the technical era.

                    <p>Our main point of contact was Kyle Winkler, the director of the program. With his help, we were able to understand the needs of the nonprofit and create an application to lessen the burden of the initial waste audit process, a free service in which Kyle performs a cursory waste audit to a potential customer.</p>
                    <p>The final deliverable reduced turnaround time and wasted energy on this free initial 'sales pitch' as well as gave Kyle a centralized location to keep all future data.</p>
                    <p>Technologies used in this project included Ruby on Rails, Paperclip, WickedPDF, etc.</p>

                        <p>As a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma, I am involved in a great many things on campus. As a sorority, we have around 90some sisters. Amazingly all our sisters are extremely dedicated to our philanthropic efforts as well as raising our campus presence. We participate in school traditions such as greek sing and booth.</p>
                        <p>Through joining a sorority, I have learned a great deal about leadership, teamwork, and how to building a two-story booth. Traditionally, Carnegie Mellon holds an event every year called Carnival. During Carnival week, classes are cancelled and the local community comes out to see the impressive booths that each organization has built for the event. These booths house games for the children and adults to play while walking through the booth. The artwork, both interior and exterior, are always extremely detailed and awards are given out to the best booths of the year.</p>
                        <p>Below is a example of a booth:</p>

                        <p>Aside from building booths, I was a recruitment counselor for our formal membership recruitment, an experience I enjoyed greatly. Being a recruitment counselor (rho sig) meant I was to disaffiliate from my chapter and provide non-bias advice to potential new members going through recruitment. Through this process, I served as a mentor to my group of girls, taking the role of a listener if they had concerns or doubts about the process or joining greek life. By being a rho sigma, I was able to interact with different types of girls and figure out how to properly communicate as well as give advice to them.</p>

                        <p>The Social Computing group of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute is focused on social computing and how the way we interact through technology has changed social norms.</p>
                        <p>I first joined the Social Computing group as an Independent Study student working with Robert Kraut and Tatiana Vlahovic, designing a study that deals with how people interact on Facebook. I learned quite a bit about experimental design, questionnaire wording and content, experimental flow, etc. as well as contributed to more technical aspects of the study such as building an application using PHP, mySQL, Facebook API, etc. The study is now ongoing and my status of that of research assistant to the social computing group.</p>

                        <p>As one of the first members of Apex, I learned a lot about Carnegie Mellon culture through the organization. Buggy is a something all to Carnegie Mellon itself. The idea is to fit a driver (my role) into a small vertical vehicle that is pushed by pushers, who are runners keeping the buggy moving along during the uphills. By joining Apex, I was able to understand the struggles of being an organization at its infancy. The experience has been invaluable to my college years and has been the avenue where I've met and connected with the most friendly, genuine, passionate people I've ever had the chance to meet. It contributed greatly to an amazing freshman experience.</p>

                        <p>The Infant Language Learning Lab is run by Professor Erik Thiessen. The lab conducts studies on infants as well as adults to find out how infants learn language and what affects an infant's ability to learn. A great deal of the studies involve statistical learning. As a research assistant at the lab, I learned how to run studies, interact with infants, and how to conduct myself in a lab.</p>
                        <p>I had joined the lab as a freshman still unsure of the path I wanted to take in my professional career. Before realizing my passion was in web development, I had seriously thought about going to medical school. Thus, the lab provided a great opportunity to get real experience dealing with the most difficult patients: infants. As someone who loves children, working at the lab was incredibly enjoyable and I gained valuable insight on how research works in academia.</p>
