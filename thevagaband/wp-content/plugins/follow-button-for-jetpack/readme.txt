== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. What does this plugin do? =
This plugin adds a floating follow button to Jetpack Powered sites.The same follow button which appears on WP.COM blogs.

= 2. Why Follow Button =
Well, the answer is very simple. I and many of the Wordpress.org users(may be you too) are jealous of the follow button that appears on 
right bottom of all wordpress.com users. And I think why Wordpress.org users must be deprived from it.Thats It! 

= 3. Will it have any other sideeffect on my blog or slow down it? =
No

= 4. I dont use Jetpack. Can I still get the Follow Button on my blog or website? =
Of Course. Yes you still get a follow button on your blog or website. You can use the "Follow" plugin written by me if you don't use Jetpack. Get the Follow plugin from http://wordpress.org/extended/plugins/follow
